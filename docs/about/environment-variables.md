# Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used in your `docker-compose.yaml` file under the `environment` key, or via the CLI using the `-e` flag, to alter the functionality and output of the app.

Docker compose example:
```yaml
services:
  m3u-editor:
    image: sparkison/m3u-editor:latest
    container_name: m3u-editor
    environment:
      - VARIABLE_NAME=value
    ...
```

or via CLI: `docker run --name m3u-editor -e VARIABLE_NAME=value ...`
