# Integrations

Enables seamless integration with media servers like Emby and Jellyfin, allowing users to import, manage, and serve VOD and series content through a unified IPTV playlist system. It securely proxies streams, synchronizes media libraries, and exposes a compatible Xtream Codes API for IPTV players. The integration ensures that media server content—movies, series, seasons, and episodes—can be browsed, streamed, and managed alongside traditional IPTV sources, providing a modern, flexible, and secure IPTV experience.
