## Platform Compatibility

Both **Emby Media Server** and **Jellyfin Media Server** are fully supported. These platforms share the same API structure, making them interchangeable for this integration.

### Tested Versions

- Emby Server 4.x and later
- Jellyfin 10.x and later

### Requirements

- Active Emby or Jellyfin server installation
- API key with appropriate permissions
- Network access from M3U Editor to your media server

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Genre Support

Movies and series can appear in multiple genre groups simultaneously, providing better content organization and discovery.

**How it works:**
- Each item's genre metadata is analyzed during sync
- Content can be placed in one genre (primary) or all genres
- Each genre entry maintains a unique `source_id` to prevent conflicts
- Users can browse the same content through different genre categories

**Example:**
A movie tagged with "Action", "Thriller", and "Sci-Fi" can appear in all three groups when "All Genres" mode is enabled.

### 2. Automatic Genre Organization

The system automatically creates and organizes groups/categories based on genre metadata.

**Features:**
- Automatic group/category creation during sync
- Clean, standardized genre names
- Batch tracking for change detection
- Hierarchical organization (VOD uses groups, series uses categories)

## 3. Change Detection and Cleanup

The sync system intelligently detects changes and keeps playlists up-to-date.

**Capabilities:**
- **Added Content**: New items automatically imported
- **Removed Content**: Deleted media removed from playlists
- **Updated Metadata**: Changes synchronized automatically
- **Batch Tracking**: UUID-based batch numbers identify current vs. outdated content

**Safety Features:**
- Only removes content that originated from Emby/Jellyfin (identified by `source_id` prefix)
- Manual additions and other sources are preserved
- Detailed logging of all cleanup operations

### 4. Flexible Streaming Options

Choose how content is accessed:

- **Server Streaming URLs**: Stream through your media server (default)
- **Direct File Paths**: Access local files directly (requires file system access)
